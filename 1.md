## Traditional programming vs machine learning

* Traditional programming is limited to scenarios in which you need to 
  derive rules
* Rules + Data => [traditional programming] => Answer
* When it comes to activity detection, traditional programming does
  a poor job. For example, we can use speed as a parameter to define
  if someone is walking or running, however how can we define if
  someone is golfing? It is heard to do that with just traditional
  programming
* In machine learning we flip the diagram and do:
  Answers + Data [machine learning] => Rules
* Now our job as programmers changes from figuring out the rules, to determining the activities, to writing the code that matches the data to the labels
* We collect a lot of data about how running, walking and golfing, then
classify those activities and derive rules from them
